# Testing conventions (Passage)
- Prefer pure time-math tests (`time.js`) and spawn scheduling determinism.
- Keep tests fast and isolated; no real timersâ€”use spies or injected clocks.
- For DOM: prefer jsdom + DOM APIs; avoid brittle selector assertions.
- Name: `*.spec.js`, table-driven where helpful.
